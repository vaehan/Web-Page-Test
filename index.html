	Small improvements;
	
	Adjusted logic in js file.  Still having issues with a "master" function that calls other functions.  Wasn't a good
	idea in college, probably not a good idea now.  Cleaned up some functions - made it a bit easier to read.

	Game runs for more than one iteration!

	Added some filler for horse names.  Think about connecting to an XML database and randomizing?

	Added wager functionality.

	Project 1:  Horse Racing

	Stopping for now, still a lot of work to do!

	I know I'm putting strings EVERYWHERE, need to find a best practice (This is definitely not it).
	Need to also figure out text formatting.
	Need to incorporate wagers and a "balance" feature.  Also need to continue the "game" past one iteration!
	Pretty sure I included the jquery library, but I'm not using it...

	Far Future Items:
	Data check the horse input.
	Add features to randomizing horses.  (Names and actual numbers - output them before starting race.)
	Create a type of Odds calculation.

<p>(3) "Twilight Tear" - <b>20%</b> blah blah blah.<p>
<p>(4) "Count Fleet" - <b>10%</b> blah blah blah.</p>
