	Project 1:  Horse Racing

	Stopping for now, still a lot of work to do!

	I know I'm putting strings EVERYWHERE, need to find a best practice (This is definitely not it).
	Need to also figure out text formatting.
	Need to incorporate wagers and a "balance" feature.  Also need to continue the "game" past one iteration!
	Pretty sure I included the jquery library, but I'm not using it...

	Far Future Items:
	Data check the horse input.
	Add features to randomizing horses.  (Names and actual numbers - output them before starting race.)
	Create a type of Odds calculation.

<h1>Horse Racing (First JS Program Test!)</h1>

<!-- I'm sure professors and professionals are rolling in their graves with this piece of code. -->

<p>There are 6 horses racing today.  By clicking on the button below, you begin the race!</p>
<p></p>

<form id="FourthForm">
	Pick your horse! (1-6):  <input type="integer" name = "UserGuess" id="UserGuess"/><br>
  Enter your wager:  <input type="integer" name = "Amount" id = "Amount"/>
	<input type="button" value="Start Race!" onclick = "results()" />
</form>

<!-- Uh, yeah...  Not sure how this piece of code works in conjunction with the button's onclick. -->
